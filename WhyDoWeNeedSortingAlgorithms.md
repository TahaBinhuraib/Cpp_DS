# Why do we Need Sorting Algorithms

------

**Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange a given array elements to a particular order or pattern.**

1. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms such as search an merge algorithms which require data to be sorted
2. Producing more human readable output
3. It is easier to and faster to locate items in a sorted list

### Types of Sorting Algorithms

1. Selection Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort 
6. Heap Sort
7. Radix Sort
